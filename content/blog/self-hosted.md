# Self Hosted

This blog is self hosted on a small raspberry pi. Smaller than the size of your hand. I choose [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V5JTMV9/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07V5JTMV9&linkCode=as2&tag=habet-20&linkId=f44d9fe1209576d61164ee27401025b5) model with a Crucial SSD you can find [here](https://amzn.to/3H57vys). You’ll need a wire like [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XLAZODE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00XLAZODE&linkCode=as2&tag=habet-20&linkId=02980243c452d2e24be82c3b9df57cd2) to connect them.

Raspberry pi sever

The OS of choice is Debian 11 because of its stability. I always prefer to encrypt my hardware, so I have nothing to worry about if it lands in other hands. [This](https://github.com/abe-101/pi-encrypted-boot-ssh) is an easy step-by-step guide to encrypt a headless server.
